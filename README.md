# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The project is to complete tasks that will provide congressional election audit details needed by the customer to discuss with the Colorado Board of Elections.  Initially the project called for candidate-based information, (total number of votes cast, complete list of candidates who received votes, total number of votes each candidate received, percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular votes), but the election board has requested additional data to complete the audit, (voter turnout for each county, percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and county with highest turnout).  The election data is stored in a .CSV file and Python programming is being used to read the file, slice the data based on the info needed and write the output of the results to a .txt file. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to complete the additional request made by the election board to determine voter turnout for each county, percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and county with highest turnout.  The results of this county-based information will be included with the customer-based results to provide the customer, and in turn the election board, the requested election analysis needed as part of their election audit.  The data for this additonal request is included in the same dataset .CSV file that contains the candidate-based data and a similar programming process will be followed using Python and writing the results .txt file.

## Results
